# RECURSION
Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It typically involves breaking down a problem into smaller, simpler sub-problems until a base case is reached, at which point the function stops calling itself and the solutions to the sub-problems are combined to solve the original problem.
